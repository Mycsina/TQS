e) The project I analyzed (euromillions from lab1/lab1_2) passed the specified quality gate, having:
  - 0 security issues
  - 0 reliability issues
  - 24 maintainability issues, all of them being code smells
  It had a coverage of 72.2%, 0% code duplication and 1 security hotspot, which I considered an issue as it would allow one to guess the next numbers generated by the PRNG.

  | Issue | Problem Description | How to solve |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Code Smell (Major) | Logging arguments should not require evaluation | String formatting should be used to avoid unnecessary evaluation of arguments; if the evaluation is necessary, it should be done inside a conditional block to avoid unnecessary computation. |
  | Code Smell (Major) | Loop counter should not be assigned to from within the loop body | Make stop condition be invariant; if not possible, use a while loop instead of a for loop. |
  | Code Smell (Major) | Use assertEquals() to compare equality | Use assertEquals() to compare equality instead of using assertTrue() with an equality check. |
